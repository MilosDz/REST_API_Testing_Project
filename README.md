# REST_API_Testing_Project

- URL to project: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12695373/TVeneUCs
- For purpose of testing, I used basic API REST skeleton written on JavaScript, created by Daniel Avellaneda in order 
to help other developers create a basic REST API in an easy way with Node.js.
